# Recommendation System

This repository holds some data and Notebooks with a small recommendation exercise.

Since I didn't have access to real data, a few Notebooks go through the
process of simulating data for use.

TO DO (2021/12/03)

 - Need to assign ratings to each item on sale.

The libraries required to run the Notebooks are:

 - pandas
 - numpy
 - jupyter
